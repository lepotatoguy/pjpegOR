## Paper Name: Orchestrating Image Retrieval and Storage over A Cloud System
[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9743811/)

## Abstract (For Beginners):

Since massive numbers of images are now being communicated from, and stored in different cloud systems, faster retrieval has become extremely important. This is more relevant, especially after COVID-19 in bandwidth-constrained environments. However, to the best of our knowledge, a coherent solution to overcome this problem is yet to be investigated in the literature. In this paper, by customizing the Progressive JPEG method, we propose a new Scan Script to ensure Faster Image Retrieval. Furthermore, we also propose a new lossy PJPEG architecture to reduce the file size as a solution to overcome our Scan Script's drawback. In order to achieve an orchestration between them, we improve the scanning of Progressive JPEG's picture payloads to ensure Faster Image Retrieval using the change in bit pixels of distinct Luma and Chroma components (Y, Cb, and Cr). The orchestration improves user experience even in bandwidth-constrained cases. We evaluate our proposed orchestration in a real-world setting across two continents encompassing a private cloud. Compared to existing alternatives, our proposed orchestration can improve user waiting time by up to 54% and decrease image size by up to 27%. Our proposed work is tested in cutting-edge cloud apps, ensuring up to 69% quicker loading time.
