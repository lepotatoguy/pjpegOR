## Paper Name: Orchestrating Image Retrieval and Storage over A Cloud System
[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9743811/)

## Abstract:

Since massive numbers of images are now being communicated from, and stored in different cloud systems, faster retrieval has become extremely important. This is more relevant, especially after COVID-19 in bandwidth-constrained environments. However, to the best of our knowledge, a coherent solution to overcome this problem is yet to be investigated in the literature. In this paper, by customizing the Progressive JPEG method, we propose a new Scan Script to ensure Faster Image Retrieval. Furthermore, we also propose a new lossy PJPEG architecture to reduce the file size as a solution to overcome our Scan Script's drawback. In order to achieve an orchestration between them, we improve the scanning of Progressive JPEG's picture payloads to ensure Faster Image Retrieval using the change in bit pixels of distinct Luma and Chroma components (Y, Cb, and Cr). The orchestration improves user experience even in bandwidth-constrained cases. We evaluate our proposed orchestration in a real-world setting across two continents encompassing a private cloud. Compared to existing alternatives, our proposed orchestration can improve user waiting time by up to 54% and decrease image size by up to 27%. Our proposed work is tested in cutting-edge cloud apps, ensuring up to 69% quicker loading time.


## Abstract (For Beginners):

We all use facebook to see people hanging out, celebrating their good times, asking for help, and so on. So, we add images in some of the facebook statuses. And when you are watching the image, it needs a bit of time to load up the image from the facebook server if you notice (you will see this better when the internet speed is slower). So, we came up with a novel approach which will compress and save the image you uploaded to the server in such a way, when the image gets load up in front of you, it will be upto 69% faster than current situation (even in slower internet).
Facebook also compresses image in this manner to show the users images faster (you may know "please send the picture on whatsapp since it gets blurry). But our approach does not loss any pixel from the images and on the other hand, gives a blazing fast loading time. 
It is being used in one of the renowned social medias you know which currently have more than 5 million users. We already tested there having more than 1 Million users.
